# Bengkel Backend

This project is the backend of a workshop management application designed to support workshop operations digitally. The backend is built using modern technologies, namely Bun and Elysia.js, with a RESTful API structure to manage data such as customers, vehicles, services, spare parts, and repair transactions. The system also supports user authentication, service history tracking, inventory management, and reporting. It uses PostgreSQL as the database, and the API is ready to be integrated with a mobile or web frontend.
